          That is lucky! How do we get inside to help out?

        I received a low-energy distress beacon broadcasted to everyone in the nearby. It's lucky I happened to already be scanning for treasu- <em>err</em>... I mean, people to help!

        Well, actually, I did lose a bunch of toolboxes when I landed on the planet. If you could find <span class="highlight">three</span> of them, then I could fix my <span class="highlight">New Developer Pain Point Collector</span>.

        Oh, you'll love it! It's this handy little device lets me get answers to all sorts of questions, theoretically... I just need to get it working first!
