        While the Librarian was originally programmed only to source knowledge 
        related to software development, she quickly learned that organizing

        as well as specific paths through the files to guide the developerâ€™s learning.<br><br>

        The Librarian has left books filled with constantly-updating history about the Tower. 
        Sometimes she uses these books like a diary, to express her fears (growing fears!) 
        that the <span class="highlight">Legacy Systems</span> has come to the Tower, 
        intending to steal some of its most sensitive resources...
