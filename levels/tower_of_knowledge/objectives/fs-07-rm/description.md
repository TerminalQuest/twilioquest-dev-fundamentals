# Removing Files

<div class="aside">

<ul>
  <li>Remove your file with <b>rm</b>.</li>
  <li>Once you're done, press <em>HACK</em>.</li>

Now that you can make files, let's learn how to delete them!

We will be using the `rm`, or "remove" command to get rid of the file you created in the previous objective. To use `rm` you write the path of the file you want to delete after the command in the terminal.

Here's an example of removing a file called "l33tcode.txt". We also use `ls` before and after to confirm that the file has been successfully deleted.

```bash
$ ls
l33tcode.txt

$ rm l33tcode.txt

$ ls
*should not show anything*
```

To complete this objective, use `rm` to remove the file you made in the previous objective. Once the file is gone, click the _HACK_ button.
